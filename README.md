2. Although there is a **minor decline in positive reviews** over time (less than 5 percentage points), overall sentiment remains **remarkably stable**, indicating sustained customer satisfaction.
3. Unverified purchase reviews show a **higher share of negativity**: roughly **25%** of unverified reviews are negative, compared to about **15%** among verified purchases, suggesting potential bias or misinformation.
4. Negative reviews are frustrated about the need for an **Amazon Music subscription** to listen to music on the device, and both negative and positive reviewers agree that the **device's speaker** could be louder
5. **Connectivity issues** (Wi-Fi and account setup) are a recurring theme in negative reviews, while positive reviewers consistently describe the setup process as **quick and straightforward**.


## Recommendations

2. Create a **bundle offer**, including the product and a three-month subscription to Amazon Music for an advantageous price; alternatively, including an extra bluetooth speaker for better sound power
3. Create detailed **hero content**, specifying points of strenght and weaknesses for each product (e.g. Amazon Echo Show has better speakers, but Amazon Echo Dot is more portable) to help customers select the right product for their needs
4. With each purchase, send a **step-by-step video tutorial** showing how to set up the product in a clear and simple way
